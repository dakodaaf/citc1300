    <main> <h1>Why the nintendo Gamecube is the one of the best</h1>
    
    <p>The Nintendo GameCube is a home video game console that was developed and released by Nintendo
         as part of the sixth generation of gaming consoles. It was the successor to the Nintendo 64 and predecessor
         to the Nintendo Wii. Here’s a detailed overview of the GameCube</p>
         <h2>Release and Timeline</h2>
         <p>Release Date: The GameCube was first released in Japan on September 14, 2001, followed by North 
            America on November 18, 2001, Europe on May 3, 2002, and Australia on May 17, 2002.

            The console was in direct competition with the Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox, and Sega Dreamcast.</p>
            <h3> Design and Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compact Cube Shape: The GameCube’s design was a small, cubic form, which made it one of the smallest home
                     consoles at the time. It was approximately 5.9 inches (15 cm) tall and 6.3 inches (16 cm) wide.
                </li>

                <li>Handle: A notable feature of the GameCube was the built-in handle on the
                     back of the console, making it one of the most portable consoles of its time.</li>

                    <li>Mini-DVD Discs: Instead of using cartridges like earlier Nintendo systems, the GameCube used 
                        mini-DVD discs (8 cm diameter). These discs were capable of holding up to 1.5 GB of
                         data, a bit less than the standard DVDs used by other consoles like the PS2 and Xbox.</li>


            </ul>
