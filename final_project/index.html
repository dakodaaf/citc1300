    <p>
        Pink Floyd is one of the most iconic and influential rock bands
         in history, known for their psychedelic sound, philosophical lyrics, and pioneering
         use of studio effects and album concepts. Pink Floyd began as a band of architecture

          students from Regent Street Polytechnic in London.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

            
          Formed in 1965 by London architecture students Roger Waters, Nick Mason, 
          and Richard Wright.</li>
            <li>
          Syd Barrett joined soon after and became the band’s creative leader, naming them "Pink Floyd" after two blues musicians.
            </li>   <li> 
          They emerged from the 1960s London underground psychedelic scene, known for experimental sounds and trippy live shows.
          </li> <li>
          Their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967), was led by Barrett and is a psychedelic classic.
          </li> <li>
          Barrett’s mental health declined due to heavy LSD use, leading to his departure in 1968.
          </li> <li>
          David Gilmour joined to replace Barrett, marking the start of a new era for the band.</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="p">By late 1967, Syd’s mental health began to deteriorate — likely worsened by heavy LSD
             use. He became erratic on stage, sometimes standing motionless or strumming one chord the entire set.

            To keep the band functioning, they brought in David Gilmour (an old friend of Syd’s) in
             1968 to play guitar and share vocals. Eventually, Syd left the band entirely.
            
            So by 1968, Pink Floyd had transformed — moving away from Barrett’s whimsical 
            psychedelia toward the deeper, more expansive, and often darker music they’d become famous for.
