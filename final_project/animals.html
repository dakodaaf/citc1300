            <h2 >Animals</h2>
<p>Animals is a studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on January 23, 1977. It’s one of their most politically charged and concept-driven albums, known for its dark, satirical take on society.

    Key Details:
    Concept: Loosely based on George Orwell's Animal Farm, the album presents a dystopian view of modern society. People are categorized into three animal types:
    
    Dogs – representing ruthless businessmen and corporate power
    
    Pigs – symbolizing corrupt political leaders
    
    Sheep – the blind followers of the system
    
    Tracklist:
    
    Pigs on the Wing (Part 1)
    
    Dogs
    
    Pigs (Three Different Ones)
    
    Sheep
    
    Pigs on the Wing (Part 2)
    
    Sound: It features long, progressive tracks with extended instrumental sections, heavy
     use of synthesizers, and biting lyrics. Compared to The Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You
      Were Here, it’s more aggressive and less polished — intentionally so.
    
    Band Lineup:
    
    Roger Waters – bass, lead vocals, concept
    
    David Gilmour – guitar, vocals
    
    Richard Wright – keyboards
    
    Nick Mason – drums
    
    Cover Art: Designed by Hipgnosis and Roger Waters, it features the now-iconic 
    image of a pig floating between two chimneys at the Battersea Power Station in London.</p>
