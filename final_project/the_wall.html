    <h3>The Wall tells the story of Pink, a character loosely based on Waters himself. The album chronicles Pink's
         descent into isolation and madness, symbolized by the metaphorical “wall” he builds around himself. The story

           <p> "The Wall" is a rock opera that tells the story of Pink, a fictional rock star who becomes increasingly isolated from the world, ultimately building a metaphorical wall around himself. It's deeply personal, drawing from Roger Waters' own life, including the loss of his father in WWII, an overprotective mother, abusive school system, and the alienation caused by fame.

            Key Themes:
            
            Isolation
            
            War and loss
            
            Childhood trauma
            
            Mental breakdown
            
            Critique of authoritarianism (especially in education) </p>

    <h3>The Wall is one of my favorite albums of all time. The album came out in 1979 and the movie was made in 1983. 
        If you want to see the movie you can find it on youtube. This is the music video of another brick in the wall. </h3>
