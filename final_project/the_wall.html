    <h3>The Wall tells the story of Pink, a character loosely based on Waters himself. The album chronicles Pink's
         descent into isolation and madness, symbolized by the metaphorical “wall” he builds around himself. The story
          explores themes like: </h3><ol>

       <li> Abandonment (his father dies in WWII)</li>
        
        <li>Overprotective parenting</li>
        
       <li> Trauma from school (harsh teachers)</li>
        
      <li> Failed relationships</li> 
        
        <li>The trappings of fame</li>
        
       <li> Mental breakdown and eventual self-judgment</li>
        
        <li>The narrative ends with Pink putting himself on trial and ultimately tearing down the wall he built.</li> 
</ol>

    <p>The Wall is one of my favorite albums of all time. The album came out in 1979 and the movie was made in 1983. 
        If you want to see the movie you can find it on youtube. This is the music video of another brick in the wall.</p>
