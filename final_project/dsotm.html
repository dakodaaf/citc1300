   <h2> 🧠 Themes</h2>
   <p>  This is a concept album exploring the pressures and anxieties of modern life. Each track reflects a different
    aspect of the human experience, especially the things that can drive people to madness: </p>
    <ul>
   <li>  Time </li>
    
   <li> Money/Greed </li>
    
   <li>  Death </li>
    
   <li> Mental illness  </li>
    
   <li> War  </li>
    
   <li>  Existentialism </li>
    
   <li>   The passage of life</li>
    
    The title implies that these pressures are the “dark side” of human existence — things we all deal with but don’t
     always face.
    </ul>
    
  <p> 🧬 Musical Style
    Progressive rock with heavy use of synths, sound effects, spoken word, and tape loops
    
    Seamless track transitions — the album flows like one continuous piece
    
    Pioneering use of studio techniques (Alan Parsons’ engineering is crucial here)
