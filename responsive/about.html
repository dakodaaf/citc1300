<h1 class="heading_style">The legend of Zelda Windwaker </h1>

<p> Just one of the many juggernauts the gamecube has to offer.The game is set on a
     group of islands in a vast sea, a departure for the series. The player controls
      series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon 
      and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred wish-granting relic.
       Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and 
       a talking sailboat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, 
       and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which
        facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role and can be controlled with a magic 
    conductor's baton called the Wind Waker. </p>

<h2 class="heading_style"> <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker" target="_blank" >Development</a></h2>

<p>The Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. Development b
    egan in 2000. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but the 
    team chose to avoid the realistic graphics of previous games. Instead, they implemented a distinctive cartoon-like
     art style created through cel shading. At its release, The Wind Waker
     received critical acclaim for its visuals, gameplay, level design,
      music, and story. The art direction proved divisive among players and contributed to comparatively
       weak sales; the game sold 4.6 million copies, far below the 7.6 million sold by Ocarina of Time. As
        a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next major Zelda installment, the more realistically 
        styled Twilight Princess. The Wind Waker's reputation improved over time, and with retrospective analyses
        , it is now considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The Wind Waker popularized the 
        "Toon Link" character, and received two direct sequels for the Nintendo DS, Phantom Hourglass 
        (2007) and Spirit Tracks (2009). A high-definition remaster,
     The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, was released for the Wii U in September 2013.</p>

     <p>Forsaken Fortress
        The Forsaken Fortress is such a cool introduction to the game, offering 
        a unique stealth-based challenge. It sets the tone for the adventure, with its 
        eerie atmosphere and intense moments of evading enemies. Plus, the looming Helmaroc 
        King is an exciting threat, making it feel like a true adventure. </p>
