             <h1>Nintendo legacy</h1>
        <p>Nintendo has a huge legacy from their first system the nes all the way to the upcoming switch 2! This page is only 
            going to cover up until the wii era.
        Before Nintendo became a home console giant, they were busy shaking up arcades. Here's how it unfolded:

        üß™ Early Experiments (Pre-Donkey Kong)
        In the early '70s, Nintendo was licensing Magnavox Odyssey tech and experimenting with light 
        gun games like the Laser Clay Shooting System in bowling alleys.
        
        First real video game: EVR Race (1975) ‚Äî an electro-mechanical horse racing game.
        
        Then came arcade titles like:
        
        Sheriff (1979)
        
        Radar Scope (1980) ‚Äì a Galaxian-style shooter that tanked in the U.S.
        
        üî• The Breakthrough: Donkey Kong (1981)
        Nintendo had tons of Radar Scope machines collecting dust in the U.S.
        
        Young designer Shigeru Miyamoto was tasked with salvaging them ‚Äî he created Donkey Kong, and the rest is history.
        
        Introduced:
        
        Jumpman (later renamed Mario)
        
        Pauline (first damsel in distress)
        
        Platforming gameplay (climbing ladders, jumping barrels)
        
        It was a huge hit worldwide and laid the foundation for Mario and modern platformers.
        
        Other Notable Arcade Titles:
        Donkey Kong Jr. (1982) ‚Äì You play as Donkey Kong‚Äôs son to save him from Mario.
        
        Mario Bros. (1983) ‚Äì First time Mario and Luigi team up.
        
        Punch-Out!! (1984) ‚Äì Dual-screen boxing game that would later be adapted for NES.</p>
